Subject: Stop losing tools on site — Bucket Sleeve™ (Australian made)

Hi [Name],

I'm Zac, founder of Bucket Sleeve™ — a new Australian company built by concreters, for concreters.

After 15 years in the trade, I got sick of:
• Walking off site missing a trowel or edger
• Chipped edges from tools rattling around
• Tools scattered in the mud or left in garden beds
• That 3rd trip back to the truck because you can't carry everything

So we invented and patented the Bucket Sleeve™.

**What it does:**
Fits inside any standard 15-23L work bucket. Holds 6 tools secure — mag floats, trowels, edgers, spinners, groovers. You arrive with 6 tools, you leave with 6 tools. No more losses.

📷 See it in action: https://github.com/davidtheaibet/learn-kids-ai/blob/main/assets/bucket-sleeve/product-group-shot.jpg

**Why it works:**
✅ Tools stay protected — reduces chips and nicks on your expensive trowels
✅ Travels in the bucket in your Ute — everything stays secure, nothing rolling around
✅ Grab your bucket, walk on site, everything's there
✅ Our trade-tough buckets are shorter and wider — designed to ride in the back of your Ute without tipping

**Plus the Kneeboard Sleeve:**
Clips onto the side of your kneeboard. No more leaving the edger behind in the garden bed. No more carrying that 3rd tool down the concrete. Everything stays with you.

P.S. — Designed by concreters who still work in the trade. We built this because we needed it.
