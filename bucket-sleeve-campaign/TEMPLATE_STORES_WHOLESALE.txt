Subject: Wholesale opportunity — Bucket Sleeve™ (Australian made, patented)

Hi [Name],

I'm Zac, founder of Bucket Sleeve™ — a new Australian company with a patented product invented by concreters with 15 years in the trade.

We're looking for trade stores and tool retailers who want to stock something different. Something that solves a real problem every concreter faces.

**The Product:**
Bucket Sleeve™ fits inside standard 15-23L work buckets. Holds 6 tools secure — mag floats, trowels, edgers, spinners, groovers. Australian designed, Australian patent.

**Why concreters buy it:**
✅ Stops tools getting lost on site — come with 6, leave with 6
✅ Protects expensive trowels from chips and nicks
✅ Travels secure in the Ute bucket — no rolling around
✅ Our trade-tough buckets are shorter and wider — made for ute trays
✅ Kneeboard sleeve clips on — no more tools left in garden beds
