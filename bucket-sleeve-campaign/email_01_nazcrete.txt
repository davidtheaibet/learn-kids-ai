Hi Nazih,

Nazcrete has built an impressive reputation in Melbourne (4.9 stars from 105+ reviews — no small feat!).

Quick question: How do your polishers carry their tools on site?

We created **Bucket Sleeve™** after 35+ years in concreting. It's a tool holder that clips onto any standard work bucket — hands-free access to trowels, edgers, and polishers.

**What makes it different:**
- Designed by actual concreters
- No modifications — clips on in seconds
- Keeps $500+ tools clean, dry, and within reach
- $39.95 retail | $18.99 wholesale for 50+ units

Or reply and I'll send our wholesale pricing.

Cheers,
