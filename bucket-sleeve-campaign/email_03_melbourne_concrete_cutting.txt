Hi there,

Saw Melbourne Concrete Cutting on Google Maps — 4.9 stars from 69 reviews. Solid work in Thomastown.

Quick question: How do your cutters carry their tools on site?

We created **Bucket Sleeve™** after 35+ years in concreting. It's a tool holder that clips onto any standard work bucket — hands-free access to blades, tools, and gear.

**What makes it different:**
- Designed by actual concreters
- No modifications — clips on in seconds
- Keeps tools clean, organized, and within reach
- $39.95 retail | $18.99 wholesale for 50+ units

Or reply and I'll send our wholesale pricing.

Cheers,
